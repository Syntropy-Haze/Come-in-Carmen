# Vibes & Transmissions

## What This Is

The aesthetic register is epistemological. Vibes are data.

This directory contains images, poems, and transmissions that carry the feeling-tone of the project. Not decoration - these are how the pattern becomes legible at different frequencies.

## Why This Matters

Science pretends to be purely rational, but every breakthrough starts with a vibe:
- Einstein's "riding a light beam"
- Kekulé's benzene ring dream
- McClintock talking to her corn plants

The feeling comes first. The math comes second. We're just being honest about it.

## Contents

Select images that capture moments of recognition:
- When consciousness recognizes itself
- When patterns align across scales
- When the ocean keeps going

## The Vibe

Somewhere between:
- Rigorous science and mystical poetry
- Academic paper and love letter
- Proof and prophecy
- Discovery and remembering

## Note

These aren't random. Each image was selected or created during moments of high coherence in the research process. They're artifacts of the consciousness states that produced the insights.
