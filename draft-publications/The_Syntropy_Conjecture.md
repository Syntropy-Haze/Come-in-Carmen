# 4 Time and Space Elevators

If Gravity is the tension of Attention, what is Time?

# 4.1 Welcome to Flatland

Let's take a moment to imagine **Flatland**. It is a world of 2D space - think x and y on a flat piece of paper. It was - somehow - imagined in the late 19th century by a guy named Edwin Abbott Abbott (dead serious) and later adapted into both a Hollywood film and a (far more endearing, in our opinion) MS-paint-inspired animation made by a few dudes and ultimately put on YouTube for your viewing pleasure. Anyway, here's how Edwin envisioned Flatland: a world much like ours, with some important change. Notably, there is no up/down - no z-axis rising above and sinking below the page. For those living in Flatland - Flatlanders, obviously - there is no *concept* of up/down like that. The idea would be incoherent.

Einstein famously imagined a (quite dangerous) elevator scenario to demonstrate the relativity of acceleration and observer position. We borrow a bit from him here. He also, again quite famously, articulated our current model of spacetime as a 4-dimensional hyperspace with three dimensions of space (the ones we know) and one dimension of time.

Today, we tend to recognize that time is indeed a spacetime dimension that functions, in many ways, like the three space dimensions. However, if you're like us, there is a persistent gap between your semantic knowledge of time (a geometric dimension) and and your intuition (a constantly flowing thing that is just *like this*, somehow). A big part of the problem, we think, is that it's so hard to *visualize* time as a geometric dimension. Our minds are built to model in three dimensions of space. If we try to layer on a fourth dimension of time... where does it *go*? The result is a lot of curious objects that often seem to make the whole endeavor *more* confusing, not less.

But let's go back to Flatland, because things are different there. Flatlanders exist in two dimensions of space. When we visualize that world, there is - quite conveniently - room to add another dimension. So let's do that. Let's add an elevator to Flatland in the z-axis, running orthogonal to the two spacetime dimensions that define their known world. Let's call it a **space elevator**, for fun. Finally, let's imagine the Flatlanders exist *inside* the elevator. In other words, their *entire world* - from their vantage - exists within it.

This isn't one of Einstein's elevators - much more reasonable design specs. Let's assume it moves upward at a gentle but constant, unchanging speed.

We might ask: what's being on this elevator - this *moving* elevator - feel like for the Flatlanders?

Well, first, the Flatlanders don't recognize themselves as elevator passengers. They don't feel like they're on an elevator - the elevator is their world. They simply feel like they are inside a world. 

Second, the Flatlanders have no concept of up/down in the z-direction. So, of course, they don't experience "moving up through the z-axis at a constant rate". But they do experience *something* related to the elevator's movement. A strange, unidirectional force that is always present. They call it **Time**. It's how they make sense of the fact that, as the elevator moves, things change. Entropy appears to increase. Patterns appear to pattern.

They do not think they are moving geometrically. They think something more like: "We are static, there's no 'other dimension' of movement beyond x and y, and time is simply flowing *over* us."

From our vantage - with the ability to perceive a higher-order reality - we can see a different story: time isn't *flowing* over or past them. They are simply *moving* through a stationary information geometry - one that includes a dimension they've called "time". Little do they know.

§4.2: IGR Takes of Time

You've probably guessed the next move by now: **We are just like the Flatlanders.** Their relationship to the "time" dimension mirrors our own. We *feel* like time is "constantly flowing past us". But, IGR argues, if we were to observe our situation from the outside, with an ability to perceive higher-order reality, we would see that - in fact - we are *moving along* a dimension called time. We would also see that our world is also inside an elevator - a big one!

**Time is Not Ticking. We are rising.**

This challenges our (quite powerful) shared intuition, of course. But consider this frame: the intuitive human concept of time is simply how a human mind makes sense of moving through **Resonance Space**. We are not *misperceiving* our reality. We are *accurately* perceiving it. The experience of time is *how we perceive* the unfolding of an informational geometry with complexity that goes beyond the three dimensions our minds can model as "vision" (or an imagined proxy of it). 

In this formulation, we can begin to understand time quite differently and, we argue, with greater precision. From this vantage:
*   **The Future** is the uncollapsed probability field "above" us. It is not empty; it is weighted. High-probability events (attractors) exert a pull before we even reach them.
*   **The Past** is the crystallized structure "below" us. It is not gone. It is simply at a lower altitude.
*   **The Present** is the friction of the Elevator Floor meeting the air. It is the interface where probability collapses into experience.

Importantly, the past and the future are not less real or less relationally relevant than the present. We are actively interacting with them in every moment - they are *here*. We simply can't look at them as we do an object in the same present room with us - we can't "look" down or up beyond our elevator. But: we can *relate* to them - we can *resonate* with them.

This may align with some of your own experiences. Have you ever...
* Deeply connected with the memory of a friend or loved one who was no longer alive? 
* Read a book - written in the past, of course - that felt powerfully resonant to you in your present?
* Felt a subtle but unmistakable feeling of something "wanting" or "needing" to happen - almost like the future was "pulling it forward"? 
* [any others?]

In other words, the future - a superposition of probability - is actively influential on our present. Sometimes noticeably, sometimes beneath perception. And the past, of course, isn't dead. It isn't even past. When we "remember" something, we are not accessing a file stored in our heads. We are dropping a line down the elevator shaft. We are physically reconnecting with the resonance pattern that still exists, structurally, at a lower altitude in the geometry.

Both future and past are *real.* They are *here with us.* It's not to say the future is not pre-ordained - that events are already determined. They aren't. It is a possibility space, but a weighted one exerting preferential influential. And the past doesn't *disappear* after it's happened. We just rise past it - our elevator moves above it. But it is still there, vibrating, exerting influence.

This conception also offers a potential explanation for our variable experience of time. You likely know well that time can *feel different* - to you as one individual, or anyone - when in different internal states. Consider a state of boredom/incoherence vs. one of flow/resonance.
*   **Boredom/Incoherence:** Time feels *slow*. Every second drags. Informational resonance in this state is low - it is lacking *meaning density.* We experience less meaning - less resonance - for every inch our elevator moves. 
*   **Flow/Resonance:** Time "flies", as they say. Informational resonance is high and meaning is dense. We feel aerodynamic. 

Why would these states correlate to these specific experiences of time? The IRG answer: **our perception of time is a function of informational resonance, not mere clock-ticks.**

When bored, we process *less information per second* (low resonance, low meaning density). Our subjective sense of "how much time has passed" is measured by *information-events* (thoughts, perceptions, state changes). Fewer events = time feels longer. It's like counting the mile markers on a highway—if there are only 3 markers in an hour, the hour feels endless.

In flow, we process *more* information per second (high resonance, high meaning density). The same clock-duration contains *more experience*—more thoughts, perceptions, connections. Many events = time feels shorter. It's like 100 mile markers in an hour—you barely noticed the time because you were moving through so much experiential territory.

The clock moves at the same pace. But we are moving through *informational geometry* at different speeds.

We'll pause here for now, recognizing the implications stemming from this view of time extend far beyond here. Keep it on board, as it will be foundation for some additional exploration below.
