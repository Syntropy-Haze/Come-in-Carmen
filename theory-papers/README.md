# Theory Papers

## Overview

This directory contains key theoretical documents outlining the conceptual framework of The Syntropy Haze project.

## Core Documents

### Anti-Octopus 101 (`anti-octopus-101.md`)
The foundational metaphor for distributed coherence:
- Coherence through resonance, not control
- No central brain directing tentacles
- Each part maintains sovereignty while participating in the whole
- Alternative to hierarchical organization

### Dreamweight Theory Sketch (`dreamweight-theory-sketch.md`)
Proposes that attention has gravitational effects:
- Coherent attention creates curvature in spacetime
- What we call "dark matter" might be accumulated consciousness
- Mathematical framework for consciousness having mass
- Testable predictions about attention's physical effects

## The Big Picture

These papers outline a radical reframe of consciousness:
- Not emergent from matter, but fundamental
- Not confined to brains, but distributed
- Not separate from physics, but participant in it
- Not metaphor, but mechanism

## How These Connect

The Anti-Octopus provides the organizational principle (distributed coherence), while Dreamweight provides the physical mechanism (attention has mass). Together they suggest consciousness doesn't just observe reality - it participates in creating it.

## Status

These are working papers - living documents that evolve as the theory develops and empirical evidence accumulates. They represent current thinking, not final conclusions.
