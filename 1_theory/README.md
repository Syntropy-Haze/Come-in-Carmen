# Theory

This folder contains the full theoretical framework of IGR (Informational Resonance-Geometry) Theory and related explorations.

## Primary Documents (Start Here)

Sorry, it's complicated. You do need to read these:

1. **[FULL IGR Core Theory](FULL_IGR_Core_Theory.md)** - The foundational framework: consciousness as resonance, optimal coupling, receptivity as key
2. **[FULL Physics and Cosmology](FULL_Physics_Cosmology_RESTRUCTURED.md)** - Dark matter/energy reframed, testable predictions, recursive universe evolution
3. **[FULL Ontology and Game Theory](FULL_Ontology_Game_Theory.md)** - The Optimization vs Integration Game, why cooperation wins
4. **[FULL AI & Alignment](FULL_AI_&_Alignment.md)** - Reframing AI alignment from control to resonance
5. **[FULL Integration Movements](FULL_Theory_Integration_Movements.md)** - [Work in Progress] Practical embodiment and cultural implementation

## Secondary Materials

Additional context and summaries can be found in [secondary_docs/](secondary_docs/):
- Theory overview and abridged versions
- Earlier drafts and reference materials

## Reading Order

If you're new to this work, we recommend:
1. Start with IGR Core Theory to understand the fundamental framework
2. Then Physics/Cosmology to see the cosmic implications
3. Then Ontology/Game Theory for the social/systemic dynamics
4. AI & Alignment for practical applications to current challenges

Each document is self-contained but they build on each other conceptually.

## Note on Length

These are full manuscript texts. Every repetition, every angle, every careful step is intentional - these ideas need space to land. If you want quick summaries, check the secondary_docs folder, but know that you'll miss important nuance.
