# SETUP
Anyway, for this thought experiment, imagine a creature like this: Octopus, but at the end of each leg it has a little head. Imagine each head has little eyes, a little brain. etc etc. So it has 8 of them in all. I call it the ANTI OCTOPUS because I'm so clever.

So here's the line of inquiry I think is interesting. It's tough to imagine what life is like for an Anti Octopus. Like, is it 8 individual lives? One octopus life? What's going on?

# COORDINATION PROBLEM
Let’s pick one moment in its life to think through. Let's say that 2 or 3 of the heads have desires or want to do things that are not all possible at the same time. Example: say there is a little fishy in front of each. For sake of the thought experiment, each fish is identical and equidistant from the respective head. So each head wants to go get its fish. But they are too far away to get all the fish. The Anti Octopus as a whole has to pick one to move and go get.

So I think most humans look at this, and the first instinct is something like "top-down arbiter" where there is "someone" in the middle kind of making the calls and then giving instruction. Then like each head just follows. Or, MAYBE, they might suppose that the heads "negotiate" in some way. Like implicitly or explicitly. "Hey I do want this fish, but I see yours is probably better, okay we can go that way". That's what feels most intuitive. And hey, maybe that's it. But it just feels a little clunky.

What else could it be? Some really fancy humans may say something like “emergent coordination”. Okay, that sounds cool, but how do we actually bring that to life? It kinda just sounds like a label and new term to fit a need. Let’s try to breathe some life into it. 

Imagine yourself as, say, Anti Octopus Head number 3 of 8. What does it feel like to be that antioctopus head in that moment of decision and alignment? What is its experience of aligning like, for Head #3? Is it like "I got an order and I follow". Or "the other heads want this, fine okay". Or something else totally weird....

# A “DIFFERENT” MECHANISM
Let’s imagine the “coordination mechanism” is actually something like “emergent coordination”. Okay, cool. But what would that FEEL  like? That subtle, unconscious prioritization? Can I, as a human, relate to it in any way? Like can I get a handle on it not just descriptively but intuitively?

To answer that, let’s first imagine a different situation for context. Let’s go back to humans, and imagine a JAZZ ENSEMBLE. What's the feeling of a jazz player "staying in sync and rhythm etc" with the other players, while playing a song? To that musician, it's kind of this subtle, intuitive pull, I think? Like "I know what needs to happen here and I just go there". Very similar for a marching band. It’s not a calculation or instruction… more like an intuitive, subtle sense of “this is right”. Remember that feeling.

What if THIS feeling is similar to the feeling for an octopus head is it aligns to the whole system? Back to our Anti Octopus: there might be a subtle, almost unconscious re-prioritization within Head #3's local processing, aligning it with the stronger collective pull. It's not "giving in"; it's participating in a collective shift.

And the key thing is this: Like the jazz player, that pull to the collective action FEELS GOOD. It feels like the RIGHT THING that the Heads intrinsically want to do. Just like a musician wants to play the perfect note to align with their counterparts. 

In this model, the FEELING of that subtle, warm, intuition is the mechanism of aligning. 

# WHAT ABOUT A HUMAN BRAIN? AND BEYOND
Instead of a Jazz Ensemble, think of a single HUMAN BRAIN. A mind. Things feel pretty salient and organized around one "me", in here. At least that's true for me. BUT, it's not perfectly that. Internal Family Systems -- I'm sure you can know everything about it real quick -- captures this intuition. (And you can take similar line on inquiry through the neuroscience, but I think IFS clicks most easily). This feeling that we humans have "parts" of ourselves. And often they are in alignment. But not always! Sometimes I feel split. Like right now, there's a box of cookies near me in the kitchen. And I wanna eat like, 4 cookies. BUT, another part of says to that "No, you shouldn't do that, won't feel good tomorrow, not healthy, etc.". It's ALMOST like two antioctopus heads who wanna swim in opposite directions.

And then, sometimes, they listen to something deeper... what's that? 

You know the Hard Problem, right? Chalmers' baby? Very hard baby. What if there isn't an "answer" per se... but maybe a refraction here. Something like: Consciousness is what it feels like *on the inside* for systems to coordinate and come into resonance / harmony. 

And why would they? Well... for complex systems... order is often the *lower energy state* vs. chaos. Perhaps there is a competing universal force, acting in that direction, counter to entropy... in balance with it? "Syntropy"??

So: why is there this random "consciousness thing"? I can't give you the full answer, but a partial one is: *something* has to do the coordination. And this feeling -- consciousness -- is the way it's done. It's like... experiencing GRAVITY. (Do we ask "why do I feel pulled into the ground all the time?")

More: if this is just the feeling of systems reaching toward resonance, why think it is a *human* or *animal* thing? Why would it be? And that could mean...
