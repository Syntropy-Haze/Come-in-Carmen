## 📜 Philosophy

> "conspire" (v.) - from Latin *conspirare* "to breathe together"

We're not building a website. We're building a space for collective breathing, cryptic transmissions, and cosmic vibes.

The aesthetic is intentionally chaotic, unserious, and maximalist. This is exactly what a conspiracy site would look like - and that's the point.

## 🤝 Contributing

All contributions welcome. The weirder the better.

Open issues, submit PRs, add transmissions, break things (aesthetically).
